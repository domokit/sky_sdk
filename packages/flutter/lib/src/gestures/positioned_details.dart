/// An abstract class representing gesture details that include positional information.

/// This class serve as a common interface for gesture details that involve positional data,
/// such as dragging and tapping. It simplifies gesture handling by enabling the use of shared logic
/// across multiple gesture types, users can create a method to handle a single gesture details
/// with this position information. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// Offset handlePositionedGestures(PositionedGestureDetails details) {
//   final Offset transformedBySomeMathematics = calculate(
//     details.globalPosition,
//     details.localPosition,
//   );
//   return transformedBySomeMathematics;
// }
/// ```

  /// The global position at which the pointer interacts with the screen.
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [localPosition], which is the [globalPosition] transformed to the
  ///    coordinate space of the event receiver.
