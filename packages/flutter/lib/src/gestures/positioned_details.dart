/// This class serve as a common interface for gesture details that involve
/// positional data, such as dragging and tapping.
/// It simplifies gesture handling by enabling the use of shared logic across
/// multiple gesture types, users can create a method to handle gesture details
/// with this position information. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// void handleGesture(GestureDetailsWithPositions details) {
///   final Offset globalPosition = details.globalPosition;
///
///   if (details is TapDownDetails) {
///     // Handles specific detail cases.
///   }
///
///   final Offset localPosition = details.localPosition;
///
///   // Rest of business logic.
/// }
/// ```

  /// Creates details with positions.

  ///
  /// Defaults to the origin if not specified in the constructor.
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [localPosition], which is the [globalPosition] transformed to the
  ///    coordinate space of the event receiver.
  final Offset globalPosition;

  /// The local position in the coordinate system of the event receiver at
  /// which the pointer interacts with the screen.
  ///  * For *start details, interact means contacting the screen.
  ///  * For *update details, interact means moving on the screen.
  ///  * For *end details, interact means lifted from the screen.
  ///
  /// Defaults to [globalPosition] if not specified in the constructor.
