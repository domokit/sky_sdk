/// having an internal clock-driven state, or depending on some system state,
/// consider using [StatefulWidget].
///
/// ## Performance considerations
///
/// The [build] method of a stateless widget is typically only called in three
/// situations: the first time the widget is inserted in the tree, when the
/// widget's parent changes its configuration (see [Element.rebuild]), and when
/// an [InheritedWidget] it depends on changes.
///
/// If a widget's parent will regularly change the widget's configuration, or if
/// it depends on inherited widgets that frequently change, then it is important
/// to optimize the performance of the [build] method to maintain a fluid
/// rendering performance.
///
/// There are several techniques one can use to minimize the impact of
/// rebuilding a stateless widget:
///
///  * Minimize the number of nodes transitively created by the build method and
///    any widgets it creates. For example, instead of an elaborate arrangement
///    of [Row]s, [Column]s, [Padding]s, and [SizedBox]es to position a single
///    child in a particularly fancy manner, consider using just an [Align] or a
///    [CustomSingleChildLayout]. Instead of an intricate layering of multiple
///    [Container]s and with [Decoration]s to draw just the right graphical
///    effect, consider a single [CustomPaint] widget.
///
///  * Use `const` widgets where possible, and provide a `const` constructor for
///    the widget so that users of the widget can also do so.
///
///  * Consider refactoring the stateless widget into a stateful widget so that
///    it can use some of the techniques described at [StatefulWidget], such as
///    caching common parts of subtrees and using [GlobalKey]s when changing the
///    tree structure.
///
///  * If the widget is likely to get rebuilt frequently due to the use of
///    [InheritedWidget]s, consider refactoring the stateless widget into
///    multiple widgets, with the parts of the tree that change being pushed to
///    the leaves. For example instead of building a tree with four widgets, the
///    inner-most widget depending on the [Theme], consider factoring out the
///    part of the build function that builds the inner-most widget into its own
///    widget, so that only the inner-most widget needs to be rebuilt when the
///    theme changes.
/// {@template flutter.flutter.widgets.framework.prefer_const_over_helper}
///  * When trying to create a reusable piece of UI, prefer using a widget
///    rather than a helper method. For example, if there was a function used to
///    build a widget, a [State.setState] call would require Flutter to entirely
///    rebuild the returned wrapping widget. If a [Widget] was used instead,
///    Flutter would be able to efficiently re-render only those parts that
///    really need to be updated. Even better, if the created widget is `const`,
///    Flutter would short-circuit most of the rebuild work.

/// and why a [Widget] is better than a helper method.

///
/// [StatefulWidget] instances themselves are immutable and store their mutable

/// [createState] method, or in objects to which that [State] subscribes, for
/// example [Stream] or [ChangeNotifier] objects, to which references are stored
/// in final fields on the [StatefulWidget] itself.
///
/// The framework calls [createState] whenever it inflates a
/// [StatefulWidget], which means that multiple [State] objects might be
/// associated with the same [StatefulWidget] if that widget has been inserted
/// into the tree in multiple places. Similarly, if a [StatefulWidget] is
/// removed from the tree and later inserted in to the tree again, the framework
/// will call [createState] again to create a fresh [State] object, simplifying
/// the lifecycle of [State] objects.
///
/// A [StatefulWidget] keeps the same [State] object when moving from one
/// location in the tree to another if its creator used a [GlobalKey] for its
/// [key]. Because a widget with a [GlobalKey] can be used in at most one
/// location in the tree, a widget that uses a [GlobalKey] has at most one
/// associated element. The framework takes advantage of this property when
/// moving a widget with a global key from one location in the tree to another
/// by grafting the (unique) subtree associated with that widget from the old
/// location to the new location (instead of recreating the subtree at the new
/// location). The [State] objects associated with [StatefulWidget] are grafted
/// along with the rest of the subtree, which means the [State] object is reused
/// (instead of being recreated) in the new location. However, in order to be
/// eligible for grafting, the widget must be inserted into the new location in
/// the same animation frame in which it was removed from the old location.
///
/// ## Performance considerations
///
/// There are two primary categories of [StatefulWidget]s.
///
/// The first is one which allocates resources in [State.initState] and disposes
/// of them in [State.dispose], but which does not depend on [InheritedWidget]s
/// or call [State.setState]. Such widgets are commonly used at the root of an
/// application or page, and communicate with subwidgets via [ChangeNotifier]s,
/// [Stream]s, or other such objects. Stateful widgets following such a pattern
/// are relatively cheap (in terms of CPU and GPU cycles), because they are
/// built once then never update. They can, therefore, have somewhat complicated
/// and deep build methods.
///
/// The second category is widgets that use [State.setState] or depend on
/// [InheritedWidget]s. These will typically rebuild many times during the
/// application's lifetime, and it is therefore important to minimize the impact
/// of rebuilding such a widget. (They may also use [State.initState] or
/// [State.didChangeDependencies] and allocate resources, but the important part
/// is that they rebuild.)
///
/// There are several techniques one can use to minimize the impact of
/// rebuilding a stateful widget:
///
///  * Push the state to the leaves. For example, if your page has a ticking
///    clock, rather than putting the state at the top of the page and
///    rebuilding the entire page each time the clock ticks, create a dedicated
///    clock widget that only updates itself.
///
///  * Minimize the number of nodes transitively created by the build method and
///    any widgets it creates. Ideally, a stateful widget would only create a
///    single widget, and that widget would be a [RenderObjectWidget].
///    (Obviously this isn't always practical, but the closer a widget gets to
///    this ideal, the more efficient it will be.)
///
///  * If a subtree does not change, cache the widget that represents that
///    subtree and re-use it each time it can be used. To do this, assign
///    a widget to a `final` state variable and re-use it in the build method. It
///    is massively more efficient for a widget to be re-used than for a new (but
///    identically-configured) widget to be created. Another caching strategy
///    consists in extracting the mutable part of the widget into a [StatefulWidget]
///    which accepts a child parameter.
///
///  * Use `const` widgets where possible. (This is equivalent to caching a
///    widget and re-using it.)
///
///  * Avoid changing the depth of any created subtrees or changing the type of
///    any widgets in the subtree. For example, rather than returning either the
///    child or the child wrapped in an [IgnorePointer], always wrap the child
///    widget in an [IgnorePointer] and control the [IgnorePointer.ignoring]
///    property. This is because changing the depth of the subtree requires
///    rebuilding, laying out, and painting the entire subtree, whereas just
///    changing the property will require the least possible change to the
///    render tree (in the case of [IgnorePointer], for example, no layout or
///    repaint is necessary at all).

///
/// [State] objects are created by the framework by calling the

/// again, the framework will call [StatefulWidget.createState] again to create
/// a fresh [State] object, simplifying the lifecycle of [State] objects.
///
/// [State] objects have the following lifecycle:
///
///  * The framework creates a [State] object by calling
///    [StatefulWidget.createState].
///  * The newly created [State] object is associated with a [BuildContext].
///    This association is permanent: the [State] object will never change its
///    [BuildContext]. However, the [BuildContext] itself can be moved around
///    the tree along with its subtree. At this point, the [State] object is
///    considered [mounted].
///  * The framework calls [initState]. Subclasses of [State] should override
///    [initState] to perform one-time initialization that depends on the
///    [BuildContext] or the widget, which are available as the [context] and
///    [widget] properties, respectively, when the [initState] method is
///    called.
///  * The framework calls [didChangeDependencies]. Subclasses of [State] should
///    override [didChangeDependencies] to perform initialization involving
///    [InheritedWidget]s. If [BuildContext.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType] is
///    called, the [didChangeDependencies] method will be called again if the
///    inherited widgets subsequently change or if the widget moves in the tree.
///  * At this point, the [State] object is fully initialized and the framework
///    might call its [build] method any number of times to obtain a
///    description of the user interface for this subtree. [State] objects can
///    spontaneously request to rebuild their subtree by calling their
///    [setState] method, which indicates that some of their internal state
///    has changed in a way that might impact the user interface in this
///    subtree.
///  * During this time, a parent widget might rebuild and request that this
///    location in the tree update to display a new widget with the same
///    [runtimeType] and [Widget.key]. When this happens, the framework will
///    update the [widget] property to refer to the new widget and then call the
///    [didUpdateWidget] method with the previous widget as an argument. [State]
///    objects should override [didUpdateWidget] to respond to changes in their
///    associated widget (e.g., to start implicit animations). The framework
///    always calls [build] after calling [didUpdateWidget], which means any
///    calls to [setState] in [didUpdateWidget] are redundant. (See also the
///    discussion at [Element.rebuild].)
///  * During development, if a hot reload occurs (whether initiated from the
///    command line `flutter` tool by pressing `r`, or from an IDE), the
///    [reassemble] method is called. This provides an opportunity to
///    reinitialize any data that was prepared in the [initState] method.
///  * If the subtree containing the [State] object is removed from the tree
///    (e.g., because the parent built a widget with a different [runtimeType]
///    or [Widget.key]), the framework calls the [deactivate] method. Subclasses
///    should override this method to clean up any links between this object
///    and other elements in the tree (e.g. if you have provided an ancestor
///    with a pointer to a descendant's [RenderObject]).
///  * At this point, the framework might reinsert this subtree into another
///    part of the tree. If that happens, the framework will ensure that it
///    calls [build] to give the [State] object a chance to adapt to its new
///    location in the tree. If the framework does reinsert this subtree, it
///    will do so before the end of the animation frame in which the subtree was
///    removed from the tree. For this reason, [State] objects can defer
///    releasing most resources until the framework calls their [dispose]
///    method.
///  * If the framework does not reinsert this subtree by the end of the current
///    animation frame, the framework will call [dispose], which indicates that
///    this [State] object will never build again. Subclasses should override
///    this method to release any resources retained by this object (e.g.,
///    stop any active animations).
///  * After the framework calls [dispose], the [State] object is considered
///    unmounted and the [mounted] property is false. It is an error to call

  /// If you just change the state directly without calling [setState], the

  /// the new state. This is especially common with [Listenable]s, such as
  /// [AnimationController]s.
  ///
  /// In such cases, it is good practice to leave a comment in the callback
  /// passed to [setState] that explains what state changed:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void _update() {
  ///   setState(() { /* The animation changed. */ });

  /// //...
  /// animation.addListener(_update);
  /// ```

  /// whether the [mounted] property is true. That said, it is better practice
  /// to cancel whatever work might trigger the [setState] rather than merely
  /// checking for [mounted] before calling [setState], as otherwise CPU cycles
  /// will be wasted.
  ///
  /// ## Design discussion
  ///
  /// The original version of this API was a method called `markNeedsBuild`, for
  /// consistency with [RenderObject.markNeedsLayout],
  /// [RenderObject.markNeedsPaint], _et al_.
  ///
  /// However, early user testing of the Flutter framework revealed that people
  /// would call `markNeedsBuild()` much more often than necessary. Essentially,
  /// people used it like a good luck charm, any time they weren't sure if they
  /// needed to call it, they would call it, just in case.
  ///
  /// Naturally, this led to performance issues in applications.
  ///
  /// When the API was changed to take a callback instead, this practice was
  /// greatly reduced. One hypothesis is that prompting developers to actually
  /// update their state in a callback caused developers to think more carefully
  /// about what exactly was being updated, and thus improved their understanding
  /// of the appropriate times to call the method.
  ///
  /// In practice, the [setState] method's implementation is trivial: it calls
  /// the provided callback synchronously, then calls [Element.markNeedsBuild].
  ///
  /// ## Performance considerations
  ///
  /// There is minimal _direct_ overhead to calling this function, and as it is
  /// expected to be called at most once per frame, the overhead is irrelevant
  /// anyway. Nonetheless, it is best to avoid calling this function redundantly
  /// (e.g. in a tight loop), as it does involve creating a closure and calling
  /// it. The method is idempotent, there is no benefit to calling it more than
  /// once per [State] per frame.
  ///
  /// The _indirect_ cost of causing this function, however, is high: it causes
  /// the widget to rebuild, possibly triggering rebuilds for the entire subtree
  /// rooted at this widget, and further triggering a relayout and repaint of
  /// the entire corresponding [RenderObject] subtree.
  ///
  /// For this reason, this method should only be called when the [build] method
  /// will, as a result of whatever state change was detected, change its result
  /// meaningfully.
  ///

  ///
  ///  * [StatefulWidget], the API documentation for which has a section on
  ///    performance considerations that are relevant here.

  ///
  /// This method is _not_ invoked at times where a developer might otherwise

  /// native methods.
  ///
  /// ### Application shutdown
  ///
  /// There is no way to predict when application shutdown will happen. For
  /// example, a user's battery could catch fire, or the user could drop the
  /// device into a swimming pool, or the operating system could unilaterally
  /// terminate the application process due to memory pressure.
  ///
  /// Applications are responsible for ensuring that they are well-behaved
  /// even in the face of a rapid unscheduled termination.
  ///
  /// To artificially cause the entire widget tree to be disposed, consider
  /// calling [runApp] with a widget such as [SizedBox.shrink].
  ///
  /// To listen for platform shutdown messages (and other lifecycle changes),
  /// consider the [AppLifecycleListener] API.
  ///
  /// {@macro flutter.widgets.runApp.dismissal}
  ///
  /// See the method used to bootstrap the app (e.g. [runApp] or [runWidget])
  /// for suggestions on how to release resources more eagerly.

  /// any side effects beyond building a widget.

  /// The framework replaces the subtree below this widget with the widget
  /// returned by this method, either by updating the existing subtree or by
  /// removing the subtree and inflating a new subtree, depending on whether the
  /// widget returned by this method can update the root of the existing
  /// subtree, as determined by calling [Widget.canUpdate].
  ///
  /// Typically implementations return a newly created constellation of widgets
  /// that are configured with information from this widget's constructor, the
  /// given [BuildContext], and the internal state of this [State] object.
  ///
  /// The given [BuildContext] contains information about the location in the
  /// tree at which this widget is being built. For example, the context
  /// provides the set of inherited widgets for this location in the tree. The
  /// [BuildContext] argument is always the same as the [context] property of
  /// this [State] object and will remain the same for the lifetime of this
  /// object. The [BuildContext] argument is provided redundantly here so that
  /// this method matches the signature for a [WidgetBuilder].
  ///
  /// ## Design discussion
  ///
  /// ### Why is the [build] method on [State], and not [StatefulWidget]?
  ///
  /// Putting a `Widget build(BuildContext context)` method on [State] rather
  /// than putting a `Widget build(BuildContext context, State state)` method
  /// on [StatefulWidget] gives developers more flexibility when subclassing
  /// [StatefulWidget].
  ///
  /// For example, [AnimatedWidget] is a subclass of [StatefulWidget] that
  /// introduces an abstract `Widget build(BuildContext context)` method for its
  /// subclasses to implement. If [StatefulWidget] already had a [build] method
  /// that took a [State] argument, [AnimatedWidget] would be forced to provide
  /// its [State] object to subclasses even though its [State] object is an
  /// internal implementation detail of [AnimatedWidget].
  ///
  /// Conceptually, [StatelessWidget] could also be implemented as a subclass of
  /// [StatefulWidget] in a similar manner. If the [build] method were on
  /// [StatefulWidget] rather than [State], that would not be possible anymore.
  ///
  /// Putting the [build] function on [State] rather than [StatefulWidget] also
  /// helps avoid a category of bugs related to closures implicitly capturing
  /// `this`. If you defined a closure in a [build] function on a
  /// [StatefulWidget], that closure would implicitly capture `this`, which is
  /// the current widget instance, and would have the (immutable) fields of that
  /// instance in scope:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // (this is not valid Flutter code)
  /// class MyButton extends StatefulWidgetX {
  ///   MyButton({super.key, required this.color});
  ///
  ///   final Color color;
  ///
  ///   @override
  ///   Widget build(BuildContext context, State state) {
  ///     return SpecialWidget(
  ///       handler: () { print('color: $color'); },
  ///     );
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// For example, suppose the parent builds `MyButton` with `color` being blue,
  /// the `$color` in the print function refers to blue, as expected. Now,
  /// suppose the parent rebuilds `MyButton` with green. The closure created by
  /// the first build still implicitly refers to the original widget and the
  /// `$color` still prints blue even through the widget has been updated to
  /// green; should that closure outlive its widget, it would print outdated
  /// information.
  ///
  /// In contrast, with the [build] function on the [State] object, closures
  /// created during [build] implicitly capture the [State] instance instead of
  /// the widget instance:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// class MyButton extends StatefulWidget {
  ///   const MyButton({super.key, this.color = Colors.teal});
  ///
  ///   final Color color;
  ///   // ...
  /// }
  ///
  /// class MyButtonState extends State<MyButton> {
  ///   // ...
  ///   @override
  ///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  ///     return SpecialWidget(
  ///       handler: () { print('color: ${widget.color}'); },
  ///     );
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Now when the parent rebuilds `MyButton` with green, the closure created by
  /// the first build still refers to [State] object, which is preserved across
  /// rebuilds, but the framework has updated that [State] object's [widget]
  /// property to refer to the new `MyButton` instance and `${widget.color}`
  /// prints green, as expected.
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [StatefulWidget], which contains the discussion on performance considerations.

/// The `of` method typically returns a non-nullable instance and asserts if the
/// [InheritedWidget] isn't found, and the `maybeOf` method returns a nullable
/// instance, and returns null if the [InheritedWidget] isn't found. The `of`
/// method is typically implemented by calling `maybeOf` internally.
///
/// Sometimes, the `of` and `maybeOf` methods return some data rather than the
/// inherited widget itself; for example, in this case it could have returned a
/// [Color] instead of the `FrogColor` widget.
///
/// Occasionally, the inherited widget is an implementation detail of another
/// class, and is therefore private. The `of` and `maybeOf` methods in that case
/// are typically implemented on the public class instead. For example, [Theme]
/// is implemented as a [StatelessWidget] that builds a private inherited
/// widget; [Theme.of] looks for that private inherited widget using
/// [BuildContext.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType] and then returns the
/// [ThemeData] inside it.
///
/// ## Calling the `of` or `maybeOf` methods
///
/// When using the `of` or `maybeOf` methods, the `context` must be a descendant
/// of the [InheritedWidget], meaning it must be "below" the [InheritedWidget]
/// in the tree.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// In this example, the `context` used is the one from the [Builder], which is

/// This class presents a set of methods that can be used from
/// [StatelessWidget.build] methods and from methods on [State] objects.
///
/// [BuildContext] objects are passed to [WidgetBuilder] functions (such as
/// [StatelessWidget.build]), and are available from the [State.context] member.
/// Some static functions (e.g. [showDialog], [Theme.of], and so forth) also
/// take build contexts so that they can act on behalf of the calling widget, or
/// obtain data specifically for the given context.
///
/// Each widget has its own [BuildContext], which becomes the parent of the
/// widget returned by the [StatelessWidget.build] or [State.build] function.
/// (And similarly, the parent of any children for [RenderObjectWidget]s.)
///
/// In particular, this means that within a build method, the build context of
/// the widget of the build method is not the same as the build context of the
/// widgets returned by that build method. This can lead to some tricky cases.
/// For example, [Theme.of(context)] looks for the nearest enclosing [Theme] of
/// the given build context. If a build method for a widget Q includes a [Theme]
/// within its returned widget tree, and attempts to use [Theme.of] passing its
/// own context, the build method for Q will not find that [Theme] object. It
/// will instead find whatever [Theme] was an ancestor to the widget Q. If the
/// build context for a subpart of the returned tree is needed, a [Builder]
/// widget can be used: the build context passed to the [Builder.builder]
/// callback will be that of the [Builder] itself.
///
/// For example, in the following snippet, the [ScaffoldState.showBottomSheet]
/// method is called on the [Scaffold] widget that the build method itself
/// creates. If a [Builder] had not been used, and instead the `context`
/// argument of the build method itself had been used, no [Scaffold] would have
/// been found, and the [Scaffold.of] function would have returned null.
///
/// ```dart
/// @override
/// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///   // here, Scaffold.of(context) returns null
///   return Scaffold(
///     appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Demo')),
///     body: Builder(

/// for this location.
///
/// Elements form a tree. Most elements have a unique child, but some widgets
/// (e.g., subclasses of [RenderObjectElement]) can have multiple children.
///
/// Elements have the following lifecycle:
///
///  * The framework creates an element by calling [Widget.createElement] on the
///    widget that will be used as the element's initial configuration.
///  * The framework calls [mount] to add the newly created element to the tree
///    at a given slot in a given parent. The [mount] method is responsible for
///    inflating any child widgets and calling [attachRenderObject] as
///    necessary to attach any associated render objects to the render tree.
///  * At this point, the element is considered "active" and might appear on
///    screen.
///  * At some point, the parent might decide to change the widget used to
///    configure this element, for example because the parent rebuilt with new
///    state. When this happens, the framework will call [update] with the new
///    widget. The new widget will always have the same [runtimeType] and key as
///    old widget. If the parent wishes to change the [runtimeType] or key of
///    the widget at this location in the tree, it can do so by unmounting this
///    element and inflating the new widget at this location.
///  * At some point, an ancestor might decide to remove this element (or an
///    intermediate ancestor) from the tree, which the ancestor does by calling
///    [deactivateChild] on itself. Deactivating the intermediate ancestor will
///    remove that element's render object from the render tree and add this
///    element to the [owner]'s list of inactive elements, causing the framework
///    to call [deactivate] on this element.
///  * At this point, the element is considered "inactive" and will not appear
///    on screen. An element can remain in the inactive state only until
///    the end of the current animation frame. At the end of the animation
///    frame, any elements that are still inactive will be unmounted.
///  * If the element gets reincorporated into the tree (e.g., because it or one
///    of its ancestors has a global key that is reused), the framework will
///    remove the element from the [owner]'s list of inactive elements, call
///    [activate] on the element, and reattach the element's render object to
///    the render tree. (At this point, the element is again considered "active"
///    and might appear on screen.)
///  * If the element does not get reincorporated into the tree by the end of
///    the current animation frame, the framework will call [unmount] on the
///    element.
///  * At this point, the element is considered "defunct" and will not be
///    incorporated into the tree in the future.

  /// continues to have e3 as a previous sibling even though its index in the list

  /// [RenderObject]. In order to trigger this move, a new [slot] value needs to

  /// The method will only rebuild if [dirty] is true. To rebuild regardless
  /// of the [dirty] flag, set `force` to true. Forcing a rebuild is convenient

  ///
  /// ## When rebuilds happen
  ///
  /// ### Terminology
  ///
  /// [Widget]s represent the configuration of [Element]s. Each [Element] has a
  /// widget, specified in [Element.widget]. The term "widget" is often used
  /// when strictly speaking "element" would be more correct.
  ///
  /// While an [Element] has a current [Widget], over time, that widget may be
  /// replaced by others. For example, the element backing a [ColoredBox] may
  /// first have as its widget a [ColoredBox] whose [ColoredBox.color] is blue,
  /// then later be given a new [ColoredBox] whose color is green.
  ///
  /// At any particular time, multiple [Element]s in the same tree may have the
  /// same [Widget]. For example, the same [ColoredBox] with the green color may
  /// be used in multiple places in the widget tree at the same time, each being
  /// backed by a different [Element].
  ///
  /// ### Marking an element dirty
  ///
  /// An [Element] can be marked dirty between frames. This can happen for various
  /// reasons, including the following:
  ///
  /// * The [State] of a [StatefulWidget] can cause its [Element] to be marked
  ///   dirty by calling the [State.setState] method.
  ///
  /// * When an [InheritedWidget] changes, descendants that have previously
  ///   subscribed to it will be marked dirty.
  ///
  /// * During a hot reload, every element is marked dirty (using [Element.reassemble]).
  ///
  /// ### Rebuilding
  ///
  /// Dirty elements are rebuilt during the next frame. Precisely how this is
  /// done depends on the kind of element. A [StatelessElement] rebuilds by
  /// using its widget's [StatelessWidget.build] method. A [StatefulElement]
  /// rebuilds by using its widget's state's [State.build] method. A
  /// [RenderObjectElement] rebuilds by updating its [RenderObject].
  ///
  /// In many cases, the end result of rebuilding is a single child widget
  /// or (for [MultiChildRenderObjectElement]s) a list of children widgets.
  ///
  /// These child widgets are used to update the [widget] property of the
  /// element's child (or children) elements. The new [Widget] is considered to
  /// correspond to an existing [Element] if it has the same [Type] and [Key].
  /// (In the case of [MultiChildRenderObjectElement]s, some effort is put into
  /// tracking widgets even when they change order; see
  /// [RenderObjectElement.updateChildren].)
  ///
  /// If there was no corresponding previous child, this results in a new
  /// [Element] being created (using [Widget.createElement]); that element is
  /// then itself built, recursively.
  ///
  /// If there was a child previously but the build did not provide a
  /// corresponding child to update it, then the old child is discarded (or, in
  /// cases involving [GlobalKey] reparenting, reused elsewhere in the element
  /// tree).
  ///
  /// The most common case, however, is that there was a corresponding previous
  /// child. This is handled by asking the child [Element] to update itself
  /// using the new child [Widget]. In the case of [StatefulElement]s, this
  /// is what triggers [State.didUpdateWidget].
  ///
  /// ### Not rebuilding
  ///
  /// Before an [Element] is told to update itself with a new [Widget], the old
  /// and new objects are compared using `operator ==`.
  ///
  /// In general, this is equivalent to doing a comparison using [identical] to
  /// see if the two objects are in fact the exact same instance. If they are,
  /// and if the element is not already marked dirty for other reasons, then the
  /// element skips updating itself as it can determine with certainty that
  /// there would be no value in updating itself or its descendants.
  ///
  /// It is strongly advised to avoid overriding `operator ==` on [Widget]
  /// objects. While doing so seems like it could improve performance, in
  /// practice, for non-leaf widgets, it results in O(N²) behavior. This is
  /// because by necessity the comparison would have to include comparing child
  /// widgets, and if those child widgets also implement `operator ==`, it
  /// ultimately results in a complete walk of the widget tree... which is then
  /// repeated at each level of the tree. In practice, just rebuilding is
  /// cheaper. (Additionally, if _any_ subclass of [Widget] used in an
  /// application implements `operator ==`, then the compiler cannot inline the
  /// comparison anywhere, because it has to treat the call as virtual just in
  /// case the instance happens to be one that has an overridden operator.)
  ///
  /// Instead, the best way to avoid unnecessary rebuilds is to cache the
  /// widgets that are returned from [State.build], so that each frame the same
  /// widgets are used until such time as they change. Several mechanisms exist
  /// to encourage this: `const` widgets, for example, are a form of automatic
  /// caching (if a widget is constructed using the `const` keyword, the same
  /// instance is returned each time it is constructed with the same arguments).
  ///
  /// Another example is the [AnimatedBuilder.child] property, which allows the
  /// non-animating parts of a subtree to remain static even as the
  /// [AnimatedBuilder.builder] callback recreates the other components.

/// An [Element] that uses a [RenderObjectWidget] as its configuration.

/// painting, and hit testing.
///
/// Contrast with [ComponentElement].
///
/// For details on the lifecycle of an element, see the discussion at [Element].
///
/// ## Writing a RenderObjectElement subclass
///
/// There are three common child models used by most [RenderObject]s:
///
/// * Leaf render objects, with no children: The [LeafRenderObjectElement] class
///   handles this case.
///
/// * A single child: The [SingleChildRenderObjectElement] class handles this
///   case.
///
/// * A linked list of children: The [MultiChildRenderObjectElement] class
///   handles this case.
///
/// Sometimes, however, a render object's child model is more complicated. Maybe
/// it has a two-dimensional array of children. Maybe it constructs children on
/// demand. Maybe it features multiple lists. In such situations, the
/// corresponding [Element] for the [Widget] that configures that [RenderObject]
/// will be a new subclass of [RenderObjectElement].
///
/// Such a subclass is responsible for managing children, specifically the
/// [Element] children of this object, and the [RenderObject] children of its
/// corresponding [RenderObject].
///
/// ### Specializing the getters
///
/// [RenderObjectElement] objects spend much of their time acting as
/// intermediaries between their [widget] and their [renderObject]. It is
/// generally recommended against specializing the [widget] getter and
/// instead casting at the various call sites to avoid adding overhead
/// outside of this particular implementation.
///
/// ```dart
/// class FooElement extends RenderObjectElement {
///   FooElement(super.widget);
///
///   // Specializing the renderObject getter is fine because
///   // it is not performance sensitive.
///   @override
///   RenderFoo get renderObject => super.renderObject as RenderFoo;
///
///   void _foo() {
///     // For the widget getter, though, we prefer to cast locally
///     // since that results in better overall performance where the
///     // casting isn't needed:
///     final Foo foo = widget as Foo;
///     // ...
///   }
///
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Slots
///
/// Each child [Element] corresponds to a [RenderObject] which should be
/// attached to this element's render object as a child.
///
/// However, the immediate children of the element may not be the ones that
/// eventually produce the actual [RenderObject] that they correspond to. For
/// example, a [StatelessElement] (the element of a [StatelessWidget])
/// corresponds to whatever [RenderObject] its child (the element returned by
/// its [StatelessWidget.build] method) corresponds to.
///
/// Each child is therefore assigned a _[slot]_ token. This is an identifier whose
/// meaning is private to this [RenderObjectElement] node. When the descendant
/// that finally produces the [RenderObject] is ready to attach it to this
/// node's render object, it passes that slot token back to this node, and that
/// allows this node to cheaply identify where to put the child render object
/// relative to the others in the parent render object.
///
/// A child's [slot] is determined when the parent calls [updateChild] to
/// inflate the child (see the next section). It can be updated by calling
/// [updateSlotForChild].
///
/// ### Updating children
///
/// Early in the lifecycle of an element, the framework calls the [mount]
/// method. This method should call [updateChild] for each child, passing in
/// the widget for that child, and the slot for that child, thus obtaining a
/// list of child [Element]s.
///
/// Subsequently, the framework will call the [update] method. In this method,
/// the [RenderObjectElement] should call [updateChild] for each child, passing
/// in the [Element] that was obtained during [mount] or the last time [update]
/// was run (whichever happened most recently), the new [Widget], and the slot.
/// This provides the object with a new list of [Element] objects.
///
/// Where possible, the [update] method should attempt to map the elements from
/// the last pass to the widgets in the new pass. For example, if one of the
/// elements from the last pass was configured with a particular [Key], and one
/// of the widgets in this new pass has that same key, they should be paired up,
/// and the old element should be updated with the widget (and the slot
/// corresponding to the new widget's new position, also). The [updateChildren]
/// method may be useful in this regard.
///
/// [updateChild] should be called for children in their logical order. The
/// order can matter; for example, if two of the children use [PageStorage]'s
/// `writeState` feature in their build method (and neither has a [Widget.key]),
/// then the state written by the first will be overwritten by the second.
///
/// #### Dynamically determining the children during the build phase
///
/// The child widgets need not necessarily come from this element's widget
/// verbatim. They could be generated dynamically from a callback, or generated
/// in other more creative ways.
///
/// #### Dynamically determining the children during layout
///
/// If the widgets are to be generated at layout time, then generating them in
/// the [mount] and [update] methods won't work: layout of this element's render
/// object hasn't started yet at that point. Instead, the [update] method can
/// mark the render object as needing layout (see
/// [RenderObject.markNeedsLayout]), and then the render object's
/// [RenderObject.performLayout] method can call back to the element to have it
/// generate the widgets and call [updateChild] accordingly.
///
/// For a render object to call an element during layout, it must use
/// [RenderObject.invokeLayoutCallback]. For an element to call [updateChild]
/// outside of its [update] method, it must use [BuildOwner.buildScope].
///
/// The framework provides many more checks in normal operation than it does
/// when doing a build during layout. For this reason, creating widgets with
/// layout-time build semantics should be done with great care.
///
/// #### Handling errors when building
///
/// If an element calls a builder function to obtain widgets for its children,
/// it may find that the build throws an exception. Such exceptions should be
/// caught and reported using [FlutterError.reportError]. If a child is needed
/// but a builder has failed in this way, an instance of [ErrorWidget] can be
/// used instead.
///
/// ### Detaching children
///
/// It is possible, when using [GlobalKey]s, for a child to be proactively
/// removed by another element before this element has been updated.
/// (Specifically, this happens when the subtree rooted at a widget with a
/// particular [GlobalKey] is being moved from this element to an element
/// processed earlier in the build phase.) When this happens, this element's
/// [forgetChild] method will be called with a reference to the affected child
/// element.
///
/// The [forgetChild] method of a [RenderObjectElement] subclass must remove the
/// child element from its child list, so that when it next [update]s its
/// children, the removed child is not considered.
///
/// For performance reasons, if there are many elements, it may be quicker to
/// track which elements were forgotten by storing them in a [Set], rather than
/// proactively mutating the local record of the child list and the identities
/// of all the slots. For example, see the implementation of
/// [MultiChildRenderObjectElement].
///
/// ### Maintaining the render object tree
///
/// Once a descendant produces a render object, it will call
/// [insertRenderObjectChild]. If the descendant's slot changes identity, it
/// will call [moveRenderObjectChild]. If a descendant goes away, it will call
/// [removeRenderObjectChild].
///
/// These three methods should update the render tree accordingly, attaching,
/// moving, and detaching the given child render object from this element's own
/// render object respectively.
///
/// ### Walking the children
///
/// If a [RenderObjectElement] object has any children [Element]s, it must
/// expose them in its implementation of the [visitChildren] method. This method
/// is used by many of the framework's internal mechanisms, and so should be
/// fast. It is also used by the test framework and [debugDumpApp].

  /// Creates an element that uses the given widget as its configuration.
